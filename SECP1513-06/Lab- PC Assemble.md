During the conduction of PC Assemble, we have been devided into several group consist of 5-6 members. My group members are Iman, Sharifah, Nurin, Wong and me.
Our task is to open the hardware component parts of computer or likely known as CPU. 

- Summarization <br>
On that day, I got to learn on how to disassemble and assemble computer. I also learn the name of the several part in the computer case, for example are wire, power supply, fan and RAM.

- Improvement <br>
For the improvement, I really hope that we can get more time to learn about the computer component in details. As for me, I really want to learn each function of the component that we assemble and disassemble on that day. 

- Reflection <br>
I learn that being a computer science student doesnt mean that i just need to mastering codding, but also need to know how to assemble and disassemble computer. I think its because we are going to spend our time a lot with our computer, thus it is crucial to know some basic things for preparation in the future.
